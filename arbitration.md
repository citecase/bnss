Bharat Aluminium Company Limited (BALCO); 2025 INSC 1457 \- S.34 Arbitration Act \- S.70 Contract Act](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2025/12/Ramesh-Kumar-Jain-v.-Bharat-Aluminium-Company-Limited--BALCO---2025-INSC-1457---S.34-Arbitration-Act---S.70-Contract-Act-.pdf)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34,37 \- Scope discussed \- Patent Illegality \- The terminology of ‘patent illegality’ indicates more than one scenario such as the findings of the arbitrator must shock the judicial conscience or the arbitrator took into account matters he shouldn’t have, or he must have failed to take into account vital matters, leading to an unjust result; or the decision is so irrational that no fair or sensible person would have arrived at it given the same facts. A classic example for the same is when an award is based on “no evidence” i.e., arbitrators cannot conjure figures or facts out of thin air to arrive at his findings. If a crucial finding is unsupported by any evidence or is a result of ignoring vital evidence that was placed before the arbitrator, it may be a ground the warrants interference. However, the said parameter must be applied with caution by keeping in mind that “no evidence” means truly no relevant evidence, not scant or weak evidence. If there is some evidence, even a single witness’s testimony or a set of documents, on which the arbitrator could rely upon or has relied upon to arrive at his conclusions, the court cannot regard the conclusion drawn by the arbitrator as patently illegal merely because that evidence has less probative value. This thin line is stood crossed only when the arbitral tribunal’s conclusion cannot be reconciled with any permissible view of the evidence. (Para 35\) where the contract is simply silent on a legitimate claim which is inherently linked to the natural corollary of contractual obligation of the parties the arbitrator will be well within his powers to interpret the contract in the light of principles of the contractual jurisprudence and apply the equity to that situation. (Para 36\)

Indian Contract Act 1872 \- Section 70 \- This provision creates a statutory right independent of contract, often termed quantum meruit or unjust enrichment remedy. It comes into play when one party confers a benefit on another in circumstances not governed by a contract, without intent to act gratuitously. Hence in such situation, the party taking the benefit is bound to pay compensation to the party who had gratuitously taken the benefits and the courts including arbitral tribunals, can award compensation under Section 70 if the conditions are met. (Para 36-37)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996- Section 11- The enquiry under Section 11 is confined to a prima facie determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and no further. The referral court is required to undertake only a prima facie determination of the existence of an arbitration agreement, and refrain from entering into contentious factual or legal issues related to authority, capacity, arbitrability, maintainability, or merits of claims- The question whether a member of a consortium can itself invoke Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is not one that admits of a monolithic or a uniform answer. Answer to that question will necessarily depend on enquiry into the terms of the principal contract, as well as the Consortium Agreement. The specific terms of the Consortium Agreement, parties to that agreement, and the nature of the rights and mutual obligations that the agreement creates will have to be examined in detail. Reference court will, however, confine its enquiry only to a prima facie satisfaction as to whether a member of a consortium qualifies as a “party” to the arbitration agreement. This prima facie satisfaction is sufficient for the referral court to constitute and refer the dispute to the Arbitral Tribunal (AT). Thereafter, it is for the AT to undertake the detailed enquiry as to whether a member of the consortium is in fact a veritable party to the arbitration agreement or not. Beyond the prima facie enquiry, it should be the discipline of the referral court to refrain from undertaking a detailed enquiry on basis of evidence to arrive at a finding of fact in the nature of a ‘proof’. (Para 15-17)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 29A \- When mandate of arbitrator has expired, his continuation is impermissible.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11 \-It should be demonstrated prima facie before the referral court that the non-signatory is a veritable party- The referral court under Section 11 is not deprived of its jurisdiction from examining whether the non-signatory is in the real sense a party to the arbitration agreement. The answer thereof will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case after examining the documents pertaining thereto. (Para 26\) If there is nothing even prima facie to show that there was any semblance of an intent to effect legal relationship between that party and the party originally granting the contract and/or to indicate that such a third party was a veritable party, such parties cannot be found to be veritable parties.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 25, 30, 38 & 32 \- Section 32 is exhaustive and covers all cases of termination of arbitral proceedings under the Act \- The power of the arbitral tribunal to pass an order to terminate the proceedings under the scheme of the Act, lies only in Section 32(2) \- Sections 25, 30 and 38 respectively, only denote the circumstances in which the tribunal would be empowered to take recourse to Section 32(2) and thereby, terminate the proceedings. (Para 416\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 32,34,14,15- The arbitral tribunal possesses the inherent procedural power to recall an order terminating the proceedings as such power is merely to correct an error apparent on the face of the record or to address a material fact that was overlooked. Where an arbitral tribunal passes an order for terminating the proceedings under the Act, the appropriate remedy available to the parties would be to first file an application for recall of such order before the arbitral tribunal itself. The arbitral tribunal would then in turn be required to examine whether the order does or does not deserve to be recalled- If a favourable order is passed for recommencing arbitration proceedings, the only option available to a party aggrieved therefrom, would be to participate in the proceedings and thereafter, challenge the final award under Section 34- If, however, the recall application is dismissed, the party aggrieved therefrom, would be empowered to approach the court under Section 14(2) \- The court would then in turn examine whether the mandate of the arbitrator stood legally terminated or not. If it finds that the proceedings were not terminated in accordance with the law, it would be empowered to either set-aside the order of termination of proceedings and remand the matter to the arbitral tribunal, or, if the circumstances so require, proceed to appoint a substitute arbitrator in terms of Section 15 (Para 416\) under no circumstances, can a party file a fresh application under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 and initiate a second round of arbitration. (Para 316\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 38 \-4th Schedule \- When one or both parties, or the parties and the arbitral tribunal, as the case may be, are unable to reach a consensus on the fee matrix, it would be open to the arbitral tribunal to determine the same in accordance with the Fourth Schedule of the Act, 1996\. The Fourth Schedule of the Act, 1996 is the model fee schedule that is binding on all. Thus, where the arbitral tribunal fixes the fee in terms of the Fourth Schedule, the parties would not be permitted to object to the same. (Para 337\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 30- The arbitral tribunal is required to terminate the proceedings, upon the settlement of the dispute by the parties. — Once the dispute between the parties stands settled, nothing remains for the arbitral tribunal to adjudicate upon. (Para 81\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- The power of review is available to an arbitral tribunal to the limited extent of curing a patent or procedural error. Thus, an arbitral tribunal has the power to entertain an application for recall of an order terminating the proceedings passed by it. (Para 311\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 14- The expression “the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate” should be given an expansive meaning to include any challenge to an order for termination of proceedings simpliciter- The termination of proceedings in essence results in the arbitrator being absolved of its duty to administer the arbitration. (Para 297\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024 \- Even the new Bill has taken no steps whatsoever to ameliorate the position of law as regards the termination of proceedings by the arbitral tribunal- Suggestions Given (Para 394-414)

Interpretation of Statues \- A provision cannot be read in an inconsistent manner. It must be read as a whole, every sub-section forming part thereof must be given a harmonious, consistent and purposeful interpretation, so as to give effect to the legislative intent underlying the enactment. It is impermissible to dismember a provision and ascribe to it multiple meanings divorced from its textual and contextual setting. (Para 229\) Marginal note- In the absence of any inherent conflict or contradiction between the marginal note and the substantive parts of a particular provision, the marginal note may be used to aid in the interpretation of the provision. (Para 214\)

Factual Summary: This case arose from a partnership dispute that was referred to a Sole Arbitrator in March 2020\. The arbitrator’s fees were set according to the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\. When the respondent filed a counter-claim, the total fees were revised to Rs. 37.50 lakh based on the ceiling set in the Fourth Schedule. Following objections and the refusal of both the appellants and the respondent to pay their equal share of the revised fees, the Sole Arbitrator terminated the arbitral proceedings on March 28, 2022, under Section 38 of the Act. The appellants’ attempt to get a new arbitrator appointed via a subsequent Section 11 petition was rejected by the High Court, leading to the appeal before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ultimately partially allowed the appeal, ordering the appointment of a substitute arbitrator based on the unique facts and the historical uncertainty surrounding the determination of fees and termination remedies at that time.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Bharat Drilling & Foundation Treatment Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand is not an authority for the proposition that an excepted clause or a prohibited claim in a contract applies only to the employer and not to the Arbitral Tribunal \- Referred to larger bench \- The approach adopted in Bharat Drilling (supra) is not in tune with the principles laid down by this Court in the recent decisions of Cox and Kings Ltd. v. SAP India Private Ltd. and In Re: Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements Under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Stamp Act, 1899- Applicability of excepted or prohibitory clauses would primarily depend upon the agreement between the parties, which alone is the guiding principle for the Arbitral Tribunal \- Contractual clauses that limit claims are founded on freedom to contract. They are agreements that crystalise informed choices of parties, explaining the incorporation of party autonomy in the statutory scheme of the Act.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 31 \- The discretion to grant interest would be available to the Arbitral Tribunal under clause (a) of sub section (7) of the Section 31 only when there is no agreement to the contrary between the parties. When the parties agree with regard to any of the aspects covered in clause (a) of sub section (7) of the Section 31 , the arbitral tribunal would seize to have any discretion with regard to the aspects mentioned in the said provision. Once there is an agreement between the parties which provides that interest shall be at a particular rate, the arbitral tribunal thereafter is left with no discretion. In such circumstances, the arbitral tribunal would be bound by the terms of the agreement. \- The express use of “Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties……” as the opening words of Section 31(7) (a) of the Act, 1996 is a clear instance of “Party Autonomy” which forms the bedrock of the arbitral process and will prevail in all cases, except where the legal provision is strictly nonderogable in nature e.g. the bar of limitation. The principle of unconscionability is inapplicable to voluntary commercial agreements between parties of equal bargaining strength. (Para 140(iv-vii))

Legal Maxim \-“Verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem’ \- It is a rule of interpretation that contracts are to be interpreted based on their plain meaning, as a whole and in accordance with the language used- In case of any ambiguity, a contract will have to be interpreted taking into consideration the surrounding facts and circumstances \-This principle would not apply in case of commercial contracts for the simple reason that a clause in a commercial contract is bilateral and has mutually been agreed upon- Where there are ambiguities, especially in cases of insurance contracts, the principle of contra proferentem steps in to aid the interpretation- It means the words of deeds are to be taken most strongly against he who uses them- The rule of contra proferentem thus protects the insured from the vagaries of an unfavourable interpretation of an ambiguous term to which it did not agree. The rule assumes special significance in standard form insurance policies, called contract d’ adhesion or boilerplate contracts, in which the insured has little to no countervailing bargaining power. (Para 117-121) Contra proferentem is not a principle of universal application. Where the terms of the contract are clear, there will be no occasion to apply the contra proferentem rule-The contra proferentem principle does not merit applicability in case of commercial contracts, for the reason that a clause in a commercial contract is bilateral. The true construction of a commercial contract must depend upon the import of the words used and not upon what the parties choose to say afterwards. Nor does subsequent conduct of the parties in the performance of the contract affect the true effect of the clear and unambiguous words used in the contract. The intention of the parties must be ascertained from the language they have used, considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances and the object of the contract. The nature and purpose of the contract is an important guide in ascertaining the intention of the parties.(Para 126-128)

Principle Of Unconscionability \- Indian Contract Act 1870 \- Section 74 \-The principle of unconscionability is inapplicable to voluntary commercial agreements between parties of equal bargaining strength (Para 140(vii)) \- Any question as to the unconscionableness of a stipulation contained in an agreement would probably arise for consideration only if it is shown that the relationship between the contracting parties was such that one of them was in a position to dominate the will of the other and that he had made use of such position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other. It is only in cases where both the conditions mentioned above are clearly established by the person who seeks to avoid the transaction and the court further finds that the bargain is in itself unconscionable that the impugned provision will be held to be unenforceable on the ground of unconscionableness. If people with their eyes open choose wilfully and knowingly to enter into a contractual transaction the court will not step in to relieve them of their obligations under such contract on the ground that the terms thereof are unconscionable. (Para 132\) Where in a contract under which interest is payable it is agreed between the parties that if such interest be not paid punctually the defaulter shall be liable to pay interest at an enhanced rate, whether from the time of default or from the time when interest first became payable under the contract such agreement does not come within Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, and is to be construed according to the intentions of the parties as expressed therein and not as a stipulation for a penalty. Such agreement is to be enforced according to its terms, unless it be found to have been when made unconscionable or fraudulent. (Para 136\)

Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Ltd., 2025 INSC 1365 \- Arbitration Act \- Waiver Regime \- Review Powers](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2025/11/Hindustan-Construction-Company-Ltd.-v.-Bihar-Rajya-Pul-Nirman-Nigam-Ltd.--2025-INSC-1365---Arbitration-Act---Waiver-Regime---Review-Powers.pdf)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 4, 12(5), 29A \- Only Seventh Schedule disqualifications attract the stringent waiver regime of Section 12(5). In all other cases viz., procedural lapses, delays, or non-jurisdictional irregularities, Section 4 applies. Accordingly, a joint application under Section 29A amounts to a valid waiver under Section 4, save in cases of statutory ineligibility under Section 12(5) \- Where the disqualification under Section 12(5) is attracted, the language being plain and mandatory, a joint application merely seeking extension, without an informed written waiver, cannot cure ineligibility. Conversely, where no such disqualification exists, the conduct of the parties, especially in jointly invoking Section 29A, constitutes waiver under Section 4\. (Para 13.11-12)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 4, 12(5), 29A \- When both parties jointly seek an extension, they signify continued consent and confidence in the tribunal. Under Section 29A(5), even a single party may apply; the other is free to oppose. The Court may, in its discretion, extend the mandate with or without substituting the arbitrator- When a party joins in seeking extension under Section 29A despite having the opportunity to object or seek termination, it signifies a higher degree of consent. However, such consent cannot be equated with an express written waiver under Section 12(5). The statutory language is categorical: only an express written post-dispute waiver can cure Seventh Schedule ineligibility. (Para 13.10)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 11 \-There is no statutory provision for review or appeal from an order under Section 11, which reflects a conscious legislative choice- While High Courts, as courts of record, do possess a limited power of review, such power is extremely circumscribed in matters governed by the Arbitration Act. It may be exercised only to correct an error apparent on the face of the record or to address a material fact that was overlooked. It cannot be used to revisit findings of law or reappreciate issues already decided. \[Context: In this case, SC held : High Court did not have the jurisdiction to reopen or review its earlier order passed under Section 11(6) of the A\&C Act. Once the appointment was made, the court became functus officio and could not sit in judgment over the very issue it had already settled. The review order cuts against the grain of the Act, undermines the principle of minimal judicial interference, and effectively converts the review into an appeal in disguise. Such an exercise cannot stand\](Para 11\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 7 \- The true test lies not in technical formality, but in intention. Where parties have acted on a shared understanding to arbitrate, they are estopped from subsequently denying the existence of such an agreement. (Para 12.5)

Constitution of India \- Article 141 \-A non-speaking dismissal of an SLP signifies only that this Court, in its discretion under Article 136, has declined to interfere. It does not amount to approval of the reasoning of the subordinate forum. The doctrine of merger does not apply to such dismissals. Dismissal of an SLP at the threshold without reasons does not elevate the underlying judgment to binding precedent unless accompanied by an express declaration of law under Article 141 \- A non-speaking dismissal of an SLP neither endorses the reasoning of the judgment challenged nor transforms it into binding precedent. At best, such a decision has persuasive value; its only legal effect is to bring finality to the dispute between the parties in that particular case.(Para 14.1-3)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 15 \- An arbitrator’s mandate terminates upon withdrawal or by agreement of the parties, and that a substitute arbitrator must be appointed following the same procedure as the original appointment- Substitution preserves continuity, and prior proceedings remain valid unless either party objects. (Para 17\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 18 \- The sub-clause provides that “if for any reason the matter shall not be referred to arbitration” is vague, uncertain, and arbitrary \- Held: The expression “for any reason” confers an unguided and absolute veto, particularly objectionable in a public contract. Such a clause fails the test of manifest arbitrariness and violates Section 18 of the Act, which mandates equal treatment of parties. (Para 12.15)

Arbitration \- Waiver, acquiescence, and estoppel \- Though waiver, acquiescence, and estoppel are often discussed together in arbitral jurisprudence, they occupy distinct conceptual spaces. Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right; acquiescence arises from passive acceptance or delay; and estoppel precludes a party from resiling from a representation on which the other has relied. The Act, however, incorporates only the doctrine of waiver – presuming parties to be conscious of their conduct and its consequences. The Act elevates silence to waiver by importing an element of intent, thereby preventing parties from approbating and reprobating. A party who has actively participated or consented to continuation of the proceedings cannot later challenge the same process merely because the result is adverse. The legislative design thus discourages tactical objections and multiplicity of proceedings. (Para 13.2)

Arbitration \- Arbitration is often a friend in conferences but a foe in practice… In practice, Arbitration has at times become more cumbersome than civil litigation.(Para 3\)

Arbitration \- Public \-private contract- Public \-private contract, must withstand not only conventional contractual scrutiny but also constitutional scrutiny- Arbitral appointments in public contracts must satisfy the requirements of fairness, equality, and non-arbitrariness under Article 14\. (Para 12.14) unilateral appointment clauses in public-private contracts violate Article 14 and offend the principle of nemo judex in causa sua. (Para 12.11)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \-Section 8,11,16- Section 11 is confined to a prima facie examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. All other questions including validity, enforceability, and jurisdiction are matters for the arbitral tribunal under Section 16 \- Referral courts must avoid undertaking detailed fact-finding or adjudication at the Section 8 or Section 11 stage. (Para 11.5)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \-Part I \- Indian Courts have no jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator for a foreign-seated arbitration, irrespective of the nationality or domicile of the parties (Para 30)- Part I of the 1996 Act has no application to arbitrations seated outside India. The seat has a juridical significance in arbitration law: it determines the courts that exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings. (Para 24\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 8,11(6) \-Once there is refusal to refer to arbitration under Section 8 of the Act, 1996, parties thereafter cannot seek reference to arbitration under Section 11(6) as the earlier refusal under Section 8 amounts to issue estoppel. (Para 37\)

Group of companies doctrine- The doctrine is not an automatic talisman for impleading every corporate entity of a group into arbitral proceedings- The doctrine is applied sparingly and only where there is compelling evidence of mutual intention of all the parties concerned to bind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement. Such intention may be inferred from direct participation in negotiation, performance of contract, or from the role played in the overall transaction. However, a mere overlap of shareholding, or the fact that entities belong to the same corporate family, is not by itself sufficient. (Para 40\)

Arbitration Clause \- Where several contracts coexist, the arbitration clause of the mother agreement governs the dispute unless a later contract unequivocally replaces it. (Para 29\)

Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order XXI Rule 22 \- The executing court is under an obligation to issue notice to the person against whom a decree is sought to be executed in the circumstances enumerated therein. The mandate of Order 21 Rule 22 (1) stands on two independent and mutually reinforcing foundations (i) the statutory compulsion-the use of word ‘shall’ in the provision leaves no discretion to the executing court in the circumstances enumerated therein, (ii) it incorporates the principles of natural justice as the legal representative of the deceased cannot be proceeded unless he is given an opportunity to contest the execution. Thus, the requirement of notice under Order 21 Rule 22 (1) to the persons enumerated therein is not a mere procedural courtesy but is the very foundation of the jurisdiction when the execution is sought against the estate of the deceased judgment debtor.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34 \- Any difference or controversy as to rate of interest clearly falls outside the scope of challenge on the ground of conflict with the public policy of India unless it is evident that the rate of interest awarded is so perverse and so unreasonable so as to shock the conscience of the Court sans which no interference is warranted in the award, whereby interest is awarded by the Arbitrator (Para 53)- The question as to whether the charging of a high rate of interest in the case of a purely commercial transaction is morally wrong entails a complex web of issues that would be contingent upon a variety of factors and perspectives \- In the commercial world, justifiability or reasonability of high interest rates would depend on the transparency of the terms and conditions of the contract entered into between the lender and the borrower, as well as the informed consent of the borrower. Ultimately, morality is inherently dependent on context, shaped by a complex interplay of cultural norms, as well as individual values. The moral implications of high interest rates are not absolute, rather they must be assessed through a nuanced lens that considers the inter-relationship between economic, social, and regulatory factors. (Para 49\) \[Context: In this case, SC held that interest at the rate of 24% as provided in the agreements between the parties could not be said to be against public policy and observed: It cannot be said that the imposition of an exorbitant interest in the background of contemporary commercial practices, would be against the fundamental policy of Indian Law, or against the basic notions of morality or justice\]

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 31 \-The grant of post-award interest under Section 31(7)(b) is mandatory. The only discretion which the arbitral tribunal has is to decide the rate of interest to be awarded. Where the arbitrator does not fix any rate of interest, then the statutory rate, as provided in Section 31(7)(b), shall apply.- Unless there is an express bar contained in the agreement, the arbitrator possesses the discretion and has jurisdiction to award interest including the post-award interest.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7 \- Mere use of the word “arbitration” in a clause of an agreement is not clinching or decisive. Section 7 presupposes an express intention of the dispute/difference being resolved through arbitration and mere reference to the term is not sufficient to meet this threshold. The A\&C Act acknowledges the existence of an arbitration agreement based on its substance rather than its form. Regardless of the formal structure, effect has to be given to an arbitration agreement in essence. Arbitration being the creature of a contract, the ad idem intention of the parties is paramount to determine whether there exists a valid arbitration agreement. That being said, the invocation of the word “arbitration” nonetheless provides, at the very least, a discernible clue to the parties’ underlying intention \-when an agreement provides that the decision of the authority will not be final and binding on the parties, or that if either party is not satisfied with the decision of the authority, he may file a civil suit seeking relief, it cannot be termed as an arbitration agreement-an arbitration agreement should have an element of the nature of finality to refer the matters to arbitration. When there has indeed been no arbitration agreement in the first place, therefore, subsequent correspondence between the parties cannot displace the original intention. Such correspondence would have indeed been sufficient to displace the original intention if it was unequivocally clear about referring the disputes to arbitration, i.e., the test mentioned under Section 7 of the A\&C Act. (Para 17-31)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 11(6)– Tests like “eye of the needle” and “ex facie meritless” are not in conformity with the principles of modern arbitration which place arbitral autonomy and judicial noninterference on the highest pedestal. (Para 3\)

### [Lancor Holdings Limited vs Prem Kumar Menon 2025 INSC 1277 \- S.34 Arbitration Act \- Effect Of Delay In Award Pronouncement](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2025/10/Lancor-Holdings-Limited-vs-Prem-Kumar-Menon--2025-INSC-1277---S.34-Arbitration-Act---Effect-Of-Delay-In-Award-Pronouncement-.pdf)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34 \- (Prior to insertion of Section 29A) \- Delay in the delivery of an arbitral award, by itself, is not sufficient to set aside that award. However, each such case would have to be examined on its own individual facts to ascertain whether that delay had an adverse impact on the final decision of the arbitral tribunal, whereby that award would stand vitiated due to the lapses committed by the arbitral tribunal owing to such delay. It is only when the effect of the undue delay in the delivery of an arbitral award is explicit and adversely reflects on the findings therein, such delay and, more so, if it remains unexplained, can be construed to result in the award being in conflict with the public policy of India, thereby attracting Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Act of 1996 or Section 34(2A) thereof, as it may also be vitiated by patent illegality. Further, it would not be necessary for an aggrieved party to invoke the remedy under Section 14(2) of the Act of 1996 as a condition precedent to lay a challenge to that delayed and tainted award under Section 34 thereof. (Para 63\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34 \- The very basis and public policy underlying the process of arbitration is that it is less time-consuming and results in speedier resolution of disputes between the parties. If that premise is not fulfilled by an unworkable arbitral award that does not resolve the disputes between the parties, on one hand, leaving them with no choice but to initiate a fresh round of arbitration/litigation but the arbitrator, in the meanwhile, also changed their positions, irrevocably altering the pre-existing balance between the parties prior to the arbitration, then such an arbitral award would not only be in conflict with the public policy of India but would also be patently illegal on the face of it. It would therefore be liable to be set aside under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and/or Section 34(2A) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\. Further, if the necessary conditions for exercise of power by this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India are made out, in terms of the Constitution Bench decision in Gayatri Balasamy vs. ISG Novasoft Technologies Limited (supra), this Court would be justified in exercising such jurisdiction.

### [Urban Infrastructure Real Estate Fund vs Neelkanth Realty Private Limited 2025 INSC 1255 \- Arbitration \- Plea Of Demurrer \- Limitation](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2025/10/Urban-Infrastructure-Real-Estate-Fund-vs-Neelkanth-Realty-Private-Limited--2025-INSC-1255---Arbitration---Plea-Of-Demurrer---Limitation.pdf)

Plea of demurrer \-The plea of demurrer is an act of objecting or taking exception or a protest. It is a pleading made by one party which “assumes” the truth of the matter as alleged by the opposite party, but sets up that it is insufficient in law to sustain the claim, or that there is some other defect in the pleadings which constitutes a legal reason as to why the suit must not be allowed to proceed further- Even assuming those facts as pleaded are true, the court does not have jurisdiction as a matter of law. The party raising the plea challenges legal sufficiency of a complaint/plaint/action rather than its factual accuracy \- A decision on demurrer has to be determined ex-facie the plaint \-At the stage of demurrer, it is only the statement of claim which is to be looked into to decide whether the matter must be thrown out at the threshold or not \- Only certain objections are capable of being decided by way of demurrer. Only those objections which do not involve questions of facts nor the adducing of any further evidence, could be decided by way of demurrer- The rule that when a mixed question of law and fact is decided on the basis of a demurrer, the issue would not be permanently foreclosed \- Since a plea of demurrer is akin to an application made under Order VII Rule 11(d), the same principles must apply. (Para 94,134)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 19 ; Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 3-The elasticity of the doctrine of party autonomy cannot be tested and pushed to the extent that it has the consequence of being at loggerheads with the duty of the Arbitral Tribunal which is manifest in Section 3 of the Act, 1963\. (Para 116\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 19,43- The doctrine of party autonomy is not limitless \- When the exercise of party autonomy is in teeth with any mandatory provision of the Act, 1996, the same could not be said to be proper. (Para 108\) \- When parties wish to adopt procedures which strike at the root of very adjudication of the dispute and have the potential to upend any established principle of fairness which our legal system has created and nurtured over the years, one has to see whether such an exercise of party autonomy is within the confines of the Act, 1996 and within the confines of the doctrine of party autonomy envisaged by the Act, 1996- (Para 112\) Any procedure agreed upon by parties cannot and must not have the consequence of the matter being decided in ignorance of settled principles of law, which includes the principles of limitation, or have the effect of the matter being decided in an unfair and lopsided manner. One must be able to distinguish between instances when party autonomy is used to dispense with mere technicalities in the pursuit of a fair and speedy resolution of the dispute, and instances when the doctrine is being disguised to shorthand fairness and justice itself. (Para 114\) There are certain non-derogable provisions within the scheme of the Act, 1996 itself, which the parties cannot ignore or attempt to bypass, even by agreement. Parties have the autonomy to decide their own procedure including the modalities of the arbitration but within the confines of the provisions of Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996\. This, by extension, would also mean that the chosen procedure must align with the underlying principles of limitation law owing to the mandate reflected in Section 43 of the Act, 1996\. (Para 119\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34- The phrase “public policy of India” must be construed narrowly and an undue expansion of the grounds of “fundamental policy of Indian law” and “most basic notions of justice or morality” respectively, cannot be countenanced. (Para 124\) The nonadoption of a “judicial approach” cannot form a valid ground for the purpose of justifying an interference to the present interim award under Section 34 of the Act, 1996\. (Para 126\) “most basic notions of justice” is, substantively and procedurally, some fundamental principle of justice which has been breached, and which shocks the conscience of the Court.” \- This ground can only be attracted under very exceptional circumstances where the conscience of the court is shocked by the infraction of the most fundamental notions or principles of justice. (Para 127\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34 \- When undertaking the exercise of severing an award, it must be ascertained whether the illegality is such that it affects the award as a whole. If not, then that portion of the award which does not suffer from any infirmity could be upheld. While severing, the courts must be vigilant to ensure that the good or viable part(s) of the award is not rendered vulnerable or unsustainable as a direct consequence of the severing. Therefore, while employing the doctrine of severance, one must walk the tight rope of not dislodging the good part of the award. (Para 131\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 43 ; Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 3- Arbitral Tribunal would also be bound by the statutory mandate underlying Section 3 of the Act, 1963 which requires the arbitrator to decide the issue of limitation in a proper and reasonable manner. (Para 102\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Arbitral Tribunal is neither required to conduct arbitration proceedings strictly like a civil court nor that the provisions of the CPC and Evidence Act respectively do not apply stricto sensu to arbitral proceedings. However, it cannot be denied that any procedure adopted in the arbitral proceedings must subscribe to and not be at variance with the underlying principles of justice. (Para 135\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11(6), 12(5)- Merely because the procedure to appoint an arbitrator provided in the clause has  become inoperative due to subsequent changes in statutory provisions, would not mean that the core of the contract referring the dispute for adjudication to arbitrator would be rendered nugatory. The amendment in the statute has been enacted with the legislative intent to enforce neutrality of the arbitrator and bring impartiality in arbitration proceedings by virtue of Section 12(5) of the 1996 Act. It cannot be justified to literally interpret the clause in the contract in a manner or at the cost of the entire arbitration mechanism itself being abandoned. The arbitration agreement must be interpreted in a purposive manner, but not literally so as to enable the parties to pursue the intended dispute redressal mechanism of contract. (Para 20\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation \- The benefit of the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 must be given to the Appellant and this period need to be excluded while counting the period of limitation for filing application for appointment of arbitrator.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34, 18 \- Audi alteram partem as a fundamental juristic principle- When a party is unable to analyse, comment or argue on a contention raised by the other party, it will certainly be deemed as a breach of natural justice and thereby, also a violation of the most fundamental notions of justice \- Such arbitral award is required to be set aside by the courts. (Para 105\) The principles of natural justice, and the public policy of India are paramount and cannot be ignored or sidelined in an attempt not to frustrate the patent or latent commercial wisdom of the parties to seek an alternative means of dispute resolution. Such issues attack the root of the Indian legal system and the courts cannot be made a mere spectator to such gross violations. (Para 112\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34, 37 \- a court under Section 37 of the 1996 Act can only determine as to whether the concerned court under Section 34 has not travelled beyond the parameters of the scope therein. No independent evaluation is permitted on the merits of the award- (Para 71\) While the initial probe is initiated during a recourse under Section 34 , and if it further affirms the award, a court exercising the mandate of Section 37 ought to employ caution and reluctance to alter with the concurrent findings. (Para 72\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 20- In the absence of the express or implied choice of law, it is the law that has the closest as well as the most real connection with the arbitration agreement, that is applicable. when a seat of arbitration is India, it would only be the courts of India that would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any disputes pertaining to the process of arbitration thereof \- The parties to a dispute are always at liberty to choose the substantive law, procedural law, and the law of the arbitration agreement so applicable \- The principle of party autonomy does not vest absolutely. Although the parties have a great deal of discretion in choosing the governing law, their choices cannot conflict with the mandatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the seat of the concerned arbitration. (Para 76-82)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34- It is the interpretation of an arbitral award which determines whether a contract or a specific provision thereof is considered part of the award or not. If a clear reliance is placed by the arbitrator on the contract, a presumption arises in favour of the incorporation, while a vague or general reference opposes such a presumption. (Para 98\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- An arbitrator lacks the power to deviate from or to reinterpret the terms of the contract while making an award. The awards must be within the parameters of the agreement entered between the parties. (Para 91\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 31(7) \- Once parties agree on the interest regime, the arbitrator’s role is confined to enforcing it and the courts would not rewrite or enlarge the award by introducing further interest at the execution stage (Para 30)- The discretion to grant interest would be available to the arbitral tribunal under Section 31(7)(a) only when there is no agreement to the contrary between the parties. When the parties agree with regard to any of the aspects covered under the said clause , the arbitral tribunal would cease to have any discretion with regard to the aspects mentioned in the said provision.

The view as taken cannot be said to be perverse or resulting in manifest injustice for this Court to intervene in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 31- Arbitral tribunal can be denuded of its power to award pendente lite interest only if the agreement/ contract between the parties is so worded that the award of pendente lite interest is either explicitly or by necessary implication \- A clause merely barring award of interest on delayed payment by itself will not be readily inferred as a bar to award pendente-lite interest by the arbitral tribunal. (Para 25\) The arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to award interest for three distinct periods, namely, pre-reference, pendente lite, and future i.e., post-award. Award of pre-reference and pendente-lite interest is subject to the agreement between the parties whereas post award interest is statutorily governed and is not subject to the agreement between the parties.- Clause (b) does not give the parties the right to ‘contract out’ interest for the post award period.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Section 33 and 34 \- Where an application under Section 33 for correction and interpretation of award is filed, irrespective of whether the arbitral tribunal upon considering such application, either makes or does not make any correction or modification or choose to render or to not render an additional award in terms of Section 33, the starting point for the period of limitation for challenging the same under Section 34 (3) would be the date of disposal of such application under Section 33 by the arbitral tribunal, as long as the application under Section 33 had been filed within the prescribed period of limitation under sub-section (1) thereto AND with notice to the other party- Neither the date of passing of the original award or date of receipt of the same by the party nor the date of receipt of the corrected award or date of receipt of the decision of the arbitrator disposing the application under Section 33 is of any significance.

Estoppel In Law \- Whether a plea of estoppel in law can be permitted to be raised by a party ignoring its conduct that resulted in the other party altering its position to its detriment in view of such conduct? In this case, the respondents initially filed a suit to restrain the appellants from interfering in the Trust’s school. The trial court dismissed the suit, but during appeal, both parties agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration. The arbitrator’s award was accepted by both sides, and the appeal was disposed of as a consent decree based on this award-Later, the respondents challenged the validity of the arbitration award, arguing that such disputes were not arbitrable under Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure \- Allowing appeal, SC observed: On the doctrine of estoppel by conduct and election the respondents cannot be permitted to now raise a plea that the compromise deed based on the award dated 30.12.2022 was a nullity in view of the provisions of Section 92 of the Code \- The issue of invalidity of the award, as a question of law, cannot be considered de hors the conduct of parties.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 42A \- *Whether it is permissible for a non-signatory to an agreement leading to arbitration proceedings to remain present in such arbitration proceedings?* \- The parties to the agreement being bound by the terms of the agreement and the sole arbitrator being required to resolve the disputes between parties to the agreement, a non-signatory to the agreement would be a stranger to such arbitration proceedings. Permitting a stranger to remain present in the arbitration proceedings especially when the award to be passed would not be binding on such stranger would be charting a course unknown to law. The remedy, if any, to a party who is not a signatory to the agreement is available under Section 36 of the Act if such award is sought to be enforced against him. The arbitrator, the arbitral institution and the parties to the arbitration agreement have to maintain confidentiality of all arbitral proceedings. The legislative intent behind maintaining confidentiality of information is quite clear. Permitting a stranger to the arbitration proceedings to remain present and observe the said proceedings would result in breach of the provisions of Section 42A of the Act. (Para 13-14) \[SC held that, the permission granted to a non-signatory to remain present in all proceedings before the sole arbitrator is without jurisdiction as well as beyond the scope of the Act.\]

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 8,11 \-Courts exercising jurisdictions under Section 11(6) and Section 8 must follow the mandate of sub-section (6A), and their scrutiny must be “confine(d) to the examination of the existence of the arbitration agreement” \- When there is an arbitration agreement. The matter must end here. (Para 27\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Fraud and Arbitrability \- Disputes involving serious fraud may not be submitted to arbitration \- “Serious allegations of fraud” is to be understood in the context of facts \- The first test is satisfied only when it can be said that the arbitration clause or agreement itself cannot be said to exist in a clear case in which the court finds that the party against whom breach is alleged cannot be said to have entered into the agreement relating to arbitration at all. The second test can be said to have been met in cases in which allegations are made against the State or its instrumentalities of arbitrary, fraudulent, or mala fide conduct, thus necessitating the hearing of the case by a writ court in which questions are raised which are not predominantly questions arising from the contract itself or breach thereof, but questions arising in the public law domain  \- Disputes involving allegations of serious fraud need more clarity so that there is certainty about the availability of the remedy. At least one instance of serious fraud will be where disputes involving allegations having criminal law implications transcend inter se disputes between the contracting parties and attain public implications, where the ramifications could directly or indirectly affect nonparties and impact, integrity in governance, accountability in public service, distribution of essential commodities, safety and security of the nation for example Consideration of such disputes have public law implications and shall ‘not be submitted to arbitration’- Arbitral Tribunal will be within its jurisdiction to consider allegations of fraud even with respect to the specific terms or clauses in the contract as an arbitration agreement stands independent of the contract and continue to bind and govern the parties even if the contract is terminated or challenged \- There is however an exception: The allegations of fraud with respect to the arbitration agreement itself stand on a different footing- In such cases, the arbitral tribunal will not examine the allegation of fraud but will consider the submission only for the purpose of examining exclusion of jurisdiction. The burden of proof is on the party who raises the plea. (Para 21\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act \- Same set of facts may lead to civil and criminal proceedings. A civil dispute could involve questions of coercion (section 15 of Contract Act), undue influence (section 16 of Contract Act), fraud (section 17 of Contract Act), misrepresentation (section 18 of Contract Act) for example, and such disputes can be adjudicated as civil proceedings for determination of civil or contractual liabilities between the parties. The same set of facts could have their co-relatives in criminal law. The mere fact that criminal proceedings can or have been instituted in respect of the same incident(s) would not per se lead to the conclusion that the dispute which is otherwise arbitrable ceases to be so.(Para 21\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7- Any agreement, or clause in an agreement, requiring or contemplating a further consent or consensus before a reference to arbitration, is not an arbitration agreement \- Mere use of the word “arbitration” or “arbitrator” in a clause will not make it an arbitration agreement, if it requires or contemplates a further or fresh consent of the parties for reference to arbitration- (Para 26\) Referred to Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. vs. IVRCL AMR Joint Venture (Para 26\) Context: In this case, the relevant clause in the Contract between parties read as follows: *In case of parties other than Govt. Agencies, the redressal of the dispute may be sought through Arbitration And Conciliation Act, 1996 As Amended By Amendment Act Of 2015* \- Whether this clause would constitute an arbitration agreement between the parties? SC held: Use of the words “may be sought”, imply that there is no subsisting agreement between parties that they, or any one of them, would have to seek settlement of dispute(s) through arbitration. It is just an enabling clause whereunder, if parties agree, they could resolve their dispute(s) through arbitration. In our view, the phraseology of clause 13 is not indicative of a binding agreement that any of the parties on its own could seek redressal of inter se dispute(s) through arbitration. (Para 31\) Essential ingredients of an arbitration agreement as follows: (a) there must be a present or future difference in connection with some contemplated affair; (b) the parties must intend to settle such difference by a private tribunal; (c) the parties must agree in writing to be bound by the decision of such tribunal; and (d) the parties must be ad idem. (Para 20\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11 \- Referral Court before appointing an arbitral tribunal will have to be prima facie satisfied that an arbitration agreement as contemplated in Section 7 exists. For this limited purpose it can scrutinize the documents relied upon by the parties in proof of its existence. Though the burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement lies on the party seeking to rely on such agreement, only prima facie proof of its existence must be adduced before the Referral Court because the Referral Court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial by allowing the parties to adduce the evidence in regard to its existence- However, where professed arbitration agreement is found in an undisputed document, no trial or inquiry is required as to its existence. In such a situation, the Court would have to simply peruse the same to satisfy itself whether it, prima facie, fulfills the essential ingredients of an arbitration agreement as contemplated under Section 7 of the 1996 Act. But where the professed arbitration agreement is not contained in any one document and is to be inferred from two or more documents, such as exchange of letters or communications, parties may raise various pleas and place various documents to prove or disprove its existence. In such a scenario, if from the documents placed, existence of an arbitration agreement, as defined in Section 7, is prima facie made out, Referral Court, instead of undertaking a deeper probe or inquiry, should refer the matter to the arbitral tribunal. More so, because opinion of the Referral Court as to existence of an arbitration agreement is neither binding on the arbitral tribunal nor the Court dealing with the arbitral award.

This would mean that the arbitral tribunal can exclude a period from the date on which the cause of action arose till the date on which the award is made for the purpose of grant of interest \- It would also mean that the arbitral tribunal can grant interest for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made. It can be a composite period or the said period can be further sub-divided, as done in the present case i.e. from the date of cause of action to filing of the claim and from the date of filing of the claim till the date of the award excluding the period when the appellant was found to be remiss.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7 \- A dispute resolution clause may only rise to the level of a valid arbitration clause or agreement when it signifies a clear intent to arbitrate, entails a binding adjudicatory process, and contemplates compliance with general arbitral norms. i. Clear Intent to Arbitrate The agreement must reflect a definitive and mutual intention to refer disputes to arbitration, excluding the jurisdiction of civil courts in respect of such matters. Consensus ad-idem or ‘meeting of the minds’ of the respective parties towards settling any disputes that may arise between them through the process of arbitration must be made out from the form and substance of the legal agreement or contract. This ideally entails the parties reducing their intention of entering into an arbitration agreement into some tangible medium. ii. Binding Adjudicatory Process The arbitration agreement must contemplate a binding and enforceable resolution of disputes. The process must culminate in a final and conclusive award, not a non-binding recommendation or mediation outcome. In essence, the result of the arbitral process should be final and binding on both the parties- iii. Compliance with Arbitration Norms While the statutory minimums do not universally require specification of seat, venue, or applicable procedural rules, best practices and several foreign jurisdictions encourage clarity in these respects to ensure legal certainty. The agreement should allow for party autonomy in the appointment of arbitrators and procedural conduct, subject to statutory safeguards. The adversarial process, which inheres in the institution of arbitration, must also be given due credence via provision for an impartial adjudicatory body, whose decisions involve deference to the principles of natural justice- The aforementioned elemental test is a conjunctive one, and not a disjunctive one \-All the elements identified hereinabove must co-exist, apart from being duly proven by the party which seeks to assert that an arbitration agreement subsists. (Para 30-33) While it is true that an arbitration clause must result in a conclusive determination, finality alone does not equate it to arbitration.(Para 39\) 

Practice and Procedure \- Arbitration \- Courts or judicial fora of our country—as a matter of judicial best policy—must show an unwavering tendency towards rejecting shoddily drafted clauses at the very threshold. Such cases, which prima facie disclose mala fides woven into the very Agreement they seek adjudication over, must be thrown out of the Court, as they have been indulged for far too long. We would complementarily urge the Courts to invoke their suo moto powers in appropriate cases wherein legal firms or counsel are found designing ‘arbitration clauses’ which deliberately mislead and misguide. The time is not far when personal liability must be assigned for such unscrupulous acts, along with the sanctioning of the harshest punitive measures against the actors. We are confident that these steps are vital to infuse probity, transparency, and professionalism into Indian arbitration. Needless to say, to uphold the integrity of the arbitral process, the sanctity of such agreements must be preserved. (Para 59\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 8 \- Once an application in due compliance with Section 8 is filed, the approach of the civil court should be not to see whether the court has jurisdiction. It should be to see whether its jurisdiction has been ousted- Once there is an arbitration agreement between the parties, a judicial authority before whom an action is brought covering the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement is under a positive obligation to refer parties to arbitration by enforcing the terms of the contract. There is no element of discretion left in the court or judicial authority to obviate the legislative mandate of compelling parties to seek recourse to arbitration \- Allegations of fraud or criminal wrongdoing or of statutory violation would not detract from the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to resolve a dispute arising out of a civil or contractual relationship on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration agreement.

❓*Whether the powers of the Court under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 will include the power to modify an arbitral award?*

Majority Judgment (4:1) \- Court has a limited power under Sections 34 and 37 of the 1996 Act to modify the arbitral award. This limited power may be exercised under the following circumstances: 

1. When the award is severable, by severing the “invalid” portion from the “valid” portion of the award.  
2. By correcting any clerical, computational or typographical errors which appear erroneous on the face of the record- A court reviewing an award under Section 34 possesses the authority to rectify computational, clerical, or typographical errors, as well as other manifest errors, provided that such modification does not necessitate a merits-based evaluation (Para 49\) \- If the modification is debatable or a doubt arises regarding its appropriateness, i.e., if the error is not apparent on the face of the record, the court will be left unable to proceed, its hands bound by the uncertainty. In such instances, it would be more appropriate for the party to seek recourse under Section 33 before the tribunal or under Section 34(4). (Para 54\)  
3. Post award interest may be modified in some circumstances (Para 85\) Section 34 court to have the authority to intervene and modify the post-award interest if the facts and circumstances justify such a change \-Court's power to both increase or decrease the post-award interest rate \- However, the court, while exercising this power, must be cautious and mindful not to overstep its role by altering the interest rate unless there are compelling and well-founded reasons to do so. (Para 76-78)

Dissenting opinion by Viswanathan J: While exercising power under Section 34 of the A\&C Act and consequently the Courts in the appellate hierarchy do not have the power to modify the arbitral award. (Para 157\)

❓If the power to modify the award is available, whether such power can be exercised only where the award is severable, and a part thereof can be modified?

Majority (4:1): Section 34 court can apply the doctrine of severability and modify a portion of the award while retaining the rest. This is subject to parts of the award being separable, legally and practically.

Dissenting opinion: Modification and severance are two different concepts while modification is not permitted under Section 34, severance of the award falling foul of Section 34 is permissible in exercise of powers under Section 34\. Such a power of severance is also available to the courts in the appellate hierarchy to the Section 34 Court. (Para 157\)

❓*Whether the power to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act, being a larger power, will include the power to modify an arbitral award and if so, to what extent? Whether the power to modify an award can be read into the power to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act?*

Majority (4:1): Power of judicial review under Section 34, and the setting aside of an award, should be read as inherently including a limited power to modify the award within the confines of Section 34 (Para 46\) 

Dissenting opinion: The power to set aside will not include the power to modify since the power to modify is not a lesser power subsumed in the power to set aside and the power to set aside and power to modify do not emanate from the same genus and are qualitatively different powers in the context of the A\&C Act.(Para 157\)

❓Can Article 142 of the Constitution of India be invoked by Supreme Court to modify awards passed by arbitrators?

Majority (4:1): The power should not be exercised where the effect of the order passed by the court would be to rewrite the award or modify the award on merits. However, the power can be exercised where it is required and necessary to bring the litigation or dispute to an end. Not only would this end protracted litigation, but it would also save parties’ money and time. (Para 84\)

Dissenting opinion: Article 142 of the Constitution of India will not be exercised by this Court to modify awards passed by arbitrators as it is well settled that the Article 142 power cannot be used to give a go by to the substantive statutory provision. (Para 156\)

❓Can Section 34 Court modify the post-award interest?

Majority Judgment: It is appropriate for the Section 34 court to have the authority to intervene and modify the post-award interest if the facts and circumstances justify such a change \-court's power to both increase or decrease the post-award interest rate. It would be incorrect to state that the court's power to interfere with this interest rate is limited solely to decreasing the interest rate. Situations may arise where the rate should be increased due to delays or obstructions in the execution of the award. Interest rates may also fluctuate over time. However, the court, while exercising this power, must be cautious and mindful not to overstep its role by altering the interest rate unless there are compelling and well-founded reasons to do so. In exercising this power, the court is not acting in an appellate capacity, but rather under limited authority. For instance, the 1996 Act stipulates a standard post-award interest rate. When the statute itself benchmarks a standard, unless there are special and specific reasons, the rate of interest stipulated by the statute should be applied. Nevertheless, this limited power is significant, as it can help avoid further rounds of litigation. Without it, the court may be forced to set aside the entire award or order a fresh round of arbitration because of an erroneous interest rate rather than simply adjusting this rate. (Para 76-78)

Dissenting opinion: Interest awarded also cannot be modified in exercise of powers of setting aside and the course of action under Section 34(4) will have to be adopted. (Para 156\)

❓Should the request under Section 34(4) be in writing?

CJI Judgment: The request may be oral. Nevertheless, there should be a request which is recorded by the court. (Para 62\)

Viswanathan J: Even an oral request under Section 34(4) can be entertained by the Court. (Para 156\)

❓Can the power under Section 34(4) can be exercised by the Court Suo Moto?

CJI Judgment: No discussion on this aspect.

Viswanathan J: The power under Section 34(4) can be exercised by the Court Suo Moto (Para 156\) If it arrives at an opinion that the award is vulnerable and the threat of setting aside is looming large and if within the parameters laid down in Section 34(4) the grounds for setting aside can be eliminated \- the case is appropriate and time is ripe for exercise of power under Section 34(4). The need for an application oral or in writing is really directory and does not militate against the exercise of Suo Moto powers in given cases by the Court. (Para 136\)

????Can award be partly set aside?

Majority Judgment: The authority to set aside an arbitral award necessarily encompasses the power to set it aside in part, rather than in its entirety.- Not all awards can be severed or segregated into separate silos. Partial setting aside may not be feasible when the “valid” and “invalid” portions are legally and practically inseparable. In simpler words, the “valid” and “invalid” portions must not be inter-dependent or intrinsically intertwined. If they are, the award cannot be set aside in part \- the power of partial setting aside should be exercised only when the valid and invalid parts of the award can be clearly segregated—particularly in relation to liability and quantum and without any corelation between valid and invalid parts. (Para 34-36)

????What is the difference between modification and setting aside?

Majority Judgment: Modification and setting aside have different consequences: the former alters the award, while the latter annuls it. However, we do not concur with the view that recognizing any modification power will inevitably lead to an examination of the merits of the dispute. (Para 39\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(4) \- the power of remand permits the court only to send the award to the tribunal for reconsideration of specific aspects. It is not an open-ended process; rather, it is a limited power, confined to limited circumstances and issues identified by the court. Upon remand, the arbitral tribunal may proceed in a manner warranted by the situation – including recording additional evidence, affording a party an opportunity to present its case if previously denied, or taking any other corrective measures necessary to cure the defect.(Para 56\) An order of remand should not be passed when such order would place the arbitral tribunal in an invidious or embarrassing position. Additionally, remand may be inappropriate when it does not serve the interests of the parties, particularly in time-sensitive matters or where it would lead to undue costs and inefficiencies. Once an order of remand is granted, the arbitral tribunal has the authority to vary, correct, review, add to, or modify the award. Notably, under Section 34(4), the tribunal’s powers, though confined, remain nonetheless substantial. (Para 60\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(4) \- SC disagreed the view taken in Kinnari Mullick (supra), which insists that an application or request under Section 34(4) must be made by a party in writing. The request may be oral.oral. Nevertheless, there should be a request which is recorded by the court. (Para 62\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(4),37-Section 37 court still possesses the power of remand stipulated in Section 34(4). Of course, the appellate court, while exercising power under Section 37, should be mindful when the award has been upheld by the Section 34 court. But the Section 37 court still possesses the jurisdiction to remand the matter to the arbitral tribunal. (Para 62\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34, 37-Section 37 (Annexure A) permits an appeal against any order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34\. To this extent, the appellate jurisdiction under Section 37 is coterminous with, and as broad as, the jurisdiction of the court deciding objections under Section 34\. (Para 62\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34- The jurisdiction conferred under Section 34 does not distinguish between statutory and non-statutory arbitration in terms of the scope of courts’ power of review. (Para 70\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34 \- Post Award Settlements \- The parties are entitled to enter into an agreement or settlement even after an award is pronounced. Such a settlement should be in accordance with the provisions of Order XXIII of the Code. The law of the land does not bar the parties from entering into a post award or post decree settlement. The only legal requirement is that such settlement must be verifiable and in accordance with law i.e., the settlement is not a result of undue influence, force, fraud, coercion, etc. (Para 80\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 43(4) \- Section 43(4) provides liberty for the parties to invoke either arbitration or court proceedings, as applicable, following the annulment of the award- the period between the commencement of arbitration and the Court’s order setting aside the award is excluded for the purposes of calculating the limitation period under the Limitation Act, 1963\. In essence, the time during which the award is in force is not counted. (Para 81\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34 \- An arbitral award cannot be set aside on a ground which is beyond the grounds mentioned in sub-sections (2) and (2A) of Section 34\. (Para 22\) Court. Section 34 is not in the nature of an appellate provision. It provides for setting aside an arbitral award that too only on very limited grounds i.e. as those contained in sub-sections (2) and (2A) of Section 34\. It is the only remedy for setting aside an arbitral award. An arbitral award is not liable to be interfered with only on the ground that the award is illegal or is erroneous in law which would require re-appraisal of the evidence adduced before the arbitral tribunal. If two views are possible, there is no scope for the court to re-appraise the evidence and to take the view other than the one taken by the arbitrator. The view taken by the arbitral tribunal is ordinarily to be accepted and allowed to prevail. Thus, the scope of interference in arbitral matters is only confined to the extent envisaged under Section 34 of the Act. The court exercising powers under Section 34 has perforce to limit its jurisdiction within the four corners of Section 34\. It cannot travel beyond Section 34\. Thus, proceedings under Section 34 are summary in nature and not like a full-fledged civil suit or a civil appeal. The award as such cannot be touched unless it is contrary to the substantive provisions of law or Section 34 of the 1996 Act or the terms of the agreement. (Para 23\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34,37- Lawyers' tendency to argue as if these proceedings were regular appeals \- They must show restraint \- The high monetary stakes involved in the proceedings should not result in unnecessarily long oral submissions or bulky written submissions. All this results in the criticism about the arbitrations in India. Therefore, there is a need to impose time limit on oral submissions in such cases. We cannot forget that this Court and the High Courts have the appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases. These Courts should be in a position to also devote sufficient time to the cases of the common man. (Para 57-58)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34,37- The powers of the Appellate Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act are not broader than those of the Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, what cannot be done in the exercise of the powers under Section 34 cannot be done in an Appeal under Section 37\. An Arbitral Award cannot be modified. (Para 56\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11,21 \- A notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the ACA is mandatory as it fixes the date of commencement of arbitration, which is essential for determining limitation periods and the applicable law, and it is a prerequisite to filing an application under Section 11\. However, merely because such a notice was not issued to certain persons who are parties to the arbitration agreement does not denude the arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead them as parties during the arbitral proceedings. (Para 40\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11 \- The purpose of an application under Section 11 is for the court to appoint an arbitrator, so as to enable dispute resolution through arbitration when the appointment procedure in the agreement fails. The court only undertakes a limited and prima facie examination into the existence of the arbitration agreement and its parties at this stage. Hence, merely because a court does not refer a certain party to arbitration in its order does not denude the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal from impleading them during the arbitral proceedings as the referral court’s view does not finally determine this issue. (Para 40\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7,16 \-The relevant consideration to determine whether a person can be made a party before the arbitral tribunal is if such a person is a party to the arbitration agreement. The arbitral tribunal must determine this jurisdictional issue in an application under Section 16 by examining whether a non- signatory is a party to the arbitration agreement as per Section 7 of the ACA.(Para 40\)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7- Non-signatories are parties to the arbitration agreement if the conduct of the signatories and non-signatories indicates mutual intention that the latter be bound by the arbitration agreement- the arbitration agreement must be in writing, the mutual intention of non-signatories to be bound by the arbitration agreement must be evidenced in writing. The non-signatory’s conduct in the formation, performance, and termination of the contract, and surrounding circumstances like direct relationship with signatory parties, commonality of subject-matter, and composite nature of transaction must be ascertained from the record of the agreement.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 31 \- Arbitration Act 1940 \-Under the 1940 Act, a stricter approach is followed that requires a clear and express clause against the payment of interest in case of difference, dispute, or misunderstanding, in case of delay of payment, or any other case whatsoever, to constitute a bar on the arbitrator from granting interest. A clause that only provides that interest shall not be granted on amounts payable under the contract would not be sufficient. On the other hand, under the 1996 Act wherein Section 31(7)(a) sanctifies party autonomy, interest is not payable the moment the contract provides otherwise-(Para 10\) The arbitrator’s power to grant interest would depend on the contractual clause in each case, and whether it expressly takes away the arbitrator’s power to grant pendente lite interest. This would have to be determined based on the phraseology of the agreement, clauses conferring powers relating to arbitration, the nature of claim and dispute referred to the arbitrator, and on what items the power to award interest is contractually barred and for which period. Further, a bar on award of interest for delayed payment would not be readily inferred as an express bar to the award of pendente lite interest by the arbitrator. (Para 13\)

So long as the view of the arbitrator is a plausible one though it may not be the only possible view, there should be no interference by the court under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. (Para 25\) \- Interference under Section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34\.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(3) ; Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 4 ; General Clauses Act, 1897 \- Section 10 \- Section 4 of the Limitation Act applies to Section 34(3) of the ACA.- Section 4 of the Limitation Act benefits a party only when the “prescribed period’’, i.e. the 3-month limitation period under Section 34(3) expires on a court holiday. In such a situation, the application under Section 34 will be considered as having been filed within the limitation period if it is filed on the next working day of the court- Section 4 of the Limitation Act does not come to the aid of the party when the 3-month limitation period expires on a day when the court was working. The 30-day condonable period expiring during the court holidays will not survive and neither Section 4, nor any other provision of the Limitation Act, will inure to the benefit of the party to enable filing of the Section 34 application immediately after reopening- Since Section 4 of the Limitation Act applies to proceedings under Section 34 of the ACA, the applicability of Section 10 of the GCA stands excluded in view of the express wording of its proviso that excludes the applicability of the provision when the Limitation Act applies.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(3) ; Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 12 \-Section 12 of the Limitation Act applies for the purpose of calculating limitation under Section 34(3), and the same is not excluded by the provisions of the ACA.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(3) ; Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 14 \- Nothing in the ACA or in the language of Section 34 excludes the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act.
